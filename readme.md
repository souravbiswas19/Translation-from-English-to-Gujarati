# Language Translation from English to Gujarati
These are the models that I have implemented for translation from English to Gujarati.

1. Facebook - NLLB
2. Google Translator
3. madlad - 400
4. MBART - large - 50 - many to many
5. MBART - large - 50 - one to many

The implementation code are provided above. I have used Kaggle Notebook and Google Colab Notebook for implementing the task.

The demonstration link of each language translator implementation is provided in the readme.md file in each folder.
